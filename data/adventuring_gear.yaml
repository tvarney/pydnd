        description: |
          This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and one side to create a bag for sleeping
          in. Some have cloth straps along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It
          can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket with the bedroll
          to stay warm or provide a ground cushion.

      tent-hanging:
        name: "Tent, Hanging"
        description: |
          A hanging tent is a small tent (able to comfortably house a single Medium creature) with a teardrop shape,
          which hangs from a sturdy anchor rope. The rope can be tied to a tree limb, grappling hookd, or even a piton
          hammered into a cliff side. Hanging tents are used primarily in mountainous terrain (where no flat surface
          may be available for camping) and swamps (where no dry ground may be available). Climbing in or out of a
          hanging tent is a full-round action that requires a DC 10 Climb check. Failure indicates another attempt must
          be made, while failure by 5 or more indicates the camper has fallen from the tent.

    hunting:
      net-bell:
        name: "Net, Bell"
        description: |
          Copper bells hang at each of the corners of this 5-foot-by-5-foot wire net. A bell net is designed to blanket
          gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise can't give it your full attention, raising an alarm if your
          possessions are disturbed. Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a
          DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells requires a DC 0 Perception
          check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a -2 penalty on
          Stealth checks.
